{"name":"PostGIS Search QGIS Plugin","tagline":"QGIS Plugin for searching PostGIS database","body":"# PostGIS Search QGIS Plugin\r\nThis project page is a guide for the using the PostGIS Search QGIS Plugin. This information should enable any user to get the plugin installed and being used without issues.\r\n\r\n##Background\r\nI tend to use QGIS for all of my desktop GIS needs and when I do I also tend to use a Web Map Service (WMS) as my backdrop map. As a result I find myself panning and zooming the map to find a location or a road that I need to look at. This is painful and sometime I do not know where a location is.\r\n\r\nSo the intention for the PostGIS Search plugin is to bring the autocomplete search we are used to using on web applications into the Desktop GIS, by allowing the user to search a database and automatically move the map to that location.\r\n\r\n##Installation\r\nThe plugin has now been accepted into the plugin repository and can therefore be download via QGIS>Plugins>Manage and Install Plugins and then find PostGIS Search on the list.\r\n\r\nThe paths for the plugin directory are:\r\n- UNIX/Mac: ~/.qgis2/python/plugins and (qgis_prefix)/share/qgis/python/plugins\r\n- Windows: ~/.qgis2/python/plugins and (qgis_prefix)/python/plugins\r\n\r\nHome directory (denoted by above ~) on Windows is usually something like C:\\Documents and Settings\\(user).\r\n\r\nWhen you next open QGIS the plugin should be available but before that there is some configuration that is required before the plugin can be used.\r\n\r\n##Configuration\r\n\r\nWithin the PostGIS_Search folder there is a postgis.ini file. This file contains the configuration that the plugin uses to know what database and column to query.\r\n\r\nOpen the postgis.ini in a text editor and the file should look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[postgis]\r\npostgisdatabase =                ;database name as exists in postgresql/postgis\r\npostgisusername =                ;database user, commonly postgres\r\npostgispassword =                ;password to match the user declared above\r\npostgishost =                    ;host computer where postgresql is, often localhost\r\npostgisport =                    ;port number, often 5432\r\npostgisschema =                  ;schema name of the table\r\npostgistable =                   ;table for the plugin to search\r\npostgissearchcolumn =            ;specific column for the plugin to search\r\npostgisdisplaycolumn =           ;comma seperated list of columns to display\r\npostgisgeomname =                ;geometry column to get coordinates to move map to\r\nsearchmethod =                   ;search type, either SQL or FTS are valid options here\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou will need to add in the relevant details. The comments on the right hand side should help you fill in the details but here is a template that I use to query Code-Point Open.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[postgis]\r\npostgisdatabase = data               \r\npostgisusername = postgres               \r\npostgispassword = postgres               \r\npostgishost = localhost                    \r\npostgisport = 5432                    \r\npostgisschema = public                  \r\npostgistable =  codepoint                 \r\npostgissearchcolumn = postcode            \r\npostgisdisplaycolumn = postcode           \r\npostgisgeomname = geom               \r\nsearchmethod = SQL                   \r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce you have altered the configuration file (postgis.ini) save your edits and close the text editor. \r\n\r\nYou should now be able to launch QGIS and enable the plugin from the Plugins>Manage and Install Plugins> then from that list select PostGIS Search.\r\n\r\nIf you want to change the database or column the plugin is searching simply open the postgis.ini configuration file and make the changes and save and exit. You DO NOT have to close down QGIS and reopen to pick up this changes. The configuration is parsed when the plugin is activated. \r\n\r\n##Errors\r\nThe plugin has been written to present the user with useful message boxes. So if the plugin does not work there should be enough of an error message to explain the problem.\r\n\r\nIf not I would double check the postgis.ini configuration file and that it has the correct details to connect to the PostGIS database you would like to query.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
